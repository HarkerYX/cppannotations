The em(set) container, like the tt(map) container, orders its elements. If
ordering is not an issue, but fast lookups are, then a hash-based sets and/or
multi-set may be preferred. The C++ standard has added such hash-based sets and
multi-sets to the language. Before using these hash-based set containers the
header file tthi(unordered_set) must have been included.
