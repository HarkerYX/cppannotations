    The i(C++0x standard) allows unions to consist of objects for which a
non-trivial constructor is defined. Here is an example of the use of such an
    emi(unrestricted union):
        verb(
    union Union
    {
        int u_int;
        double u_double;
        std::string u_string;
    };
        )
    Before the C++0x standard the tt(u_string) field could not be used.

Unrestricted unions are not yet supported by the tt(g++) compiler.
