Unions revived at the introduction of C++11's unrestricted unions. 
In this section we'll have a look at how to used them as 
semantic values in a Bisonc++ generated parser.

    itt(int) values;
    itt(textual) values of type tt(string);
    )



Here is tt(Semantic)'s interface:
    verbinclude(poly/semantic/semantic.h)
