The function templates introduced in the previous section will not do
promotions. E.g., a statement like 
        verb(
  result = rhs + 2;
        )
    generates a compilation error as promotions are not recognized by 
the template argument deduction algoritm. Currently, the above statement needs
to be rewritten to have it accepted by the compiler:
        verb(
  result = rhs + Class(2);
        )
