    Having constructed the unary template wrapper, the construction of the
binary template wrapper should offer no surprises. The function object's
tt(operator()()) is now called with two, rather than one argument. Coining the
classname tt(Wrap2), it's implementation is almost identical to tt(Wrap1)'s
implementation. Here it is:
        verbinclude(concrete/wrap/wrap2.h)
    As with the unary template wrapper (see section ref(WRAPONE)), an
additional class may be defined not expecting a local context.
