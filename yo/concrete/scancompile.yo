    The final program is constructed in two steps. These steps are given for a
i(Unix) system, on which ti(flexc++) and the i(Gnu) bf(C++) compiler ti(g++)
have been installed:
    itemization(
    it() First, the lexical scanner's source is created using tt(flexc++). For
this the following command can be given:
        verb(
    flexc++ lexer
        )
    it() Next, all sources are compiled and linked:
        verb(
    g++ --std=c++0x -Wall *.cc
        )
     )
