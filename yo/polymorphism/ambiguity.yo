Let's investigate closer why an tt(AirAuto) introduces i(ambiguity), when
derived from tt(Auto) and tt(Air).
    itemization(
    it() An tt(AirAuto) is an tt(Auto), hence a tt(Land), and hence a
tt(Vehicle).
    it() However, an tt(AirAuto) is also an tt(Air), and hence a tt(Vehicle).
    )
    The duplication of tt(Vehicle) data is further illustrated in
fig(ambiguity).
    figure(polymorphism/ambiguity)
        (Duplication of a base class in multiple derivation.)
        (ambiguity)
    The internal organization of an tt(AirAuto) is shown in
fig(InternalOrganization)
    figure(polymorphism/internal)
        (Internal organization of an tt(AirAuto) object.)
        (InternalOrganization)
    The bf(C++) compiler detects the ambiguity in an tt(AirAuto) object,
and will therefore not  compile  statements like:
        verb(
    AirAuto jBond;
    cout << jBond.weight() << '\n';
        )
    Which member function tt(weight) to call cannot be determined by the
compiler but the programmer has two possibilities to resolve the ambiguity for
the compiler:
    itemization(
    it() First, the function call where the ambiguity originates can be
modified. The ambiguity is resolved using the i(scope resolution operator):
        verb(
    // let's hope that the weight is kept in the Auto
    // part of the object..
    cout << jBond.Auto::weight() << '\n';
        )
    The scope resolution operator and the class name are put right before
the name of the member function.
    it() Second, a dedicated function tt(weight) could be created for
the class tt(AirAuto):
        verb(
    int AirAuto::weight() const
    {
        return Auto::weight();
    }
        )
    )
    The second possibility is preferred as it does not require the compiler to
flag an error; nor does it require the programmer using the class
tt(AirAuto) to take special precautions.

    However, there exists a more elegant solution, discussed in the next
section.
