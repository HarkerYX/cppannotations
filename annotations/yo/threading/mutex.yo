    The C++11 standard offers a series of i(mutex) classes to protect shared
data.  

Before using mutexes the tthi(mutex) header file must be included.

COMMENT(
The library defines a number of atomic operations (Clause 29 ) and operations
on mutexes (Clause 30 ) that are specially identified as synchronization
operations. 

These operations play a special role in making assignments in one thread
visible to another. A synchronization operation on one or more memory
locations is either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a release
operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either
an acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In
addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special
characteristics.

Note: For example, a call that acquires a mutex will perform an acquire
operation on the locations comprising the mutex. Correspondingly, a call that
releases the same mutex will perform a release operation on those same
locations. Informally, performing a release operation on A forces prior side
effects on other memory locations to become visible to other threads that
later perform a consume or an acquire operation on A . `Relaxed' atomic
operations are not synchronization operations even though, like
synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.

--------------

In other words, function executions do not interleave with each other.

The execution of a program contains a data race if it contains two conflicting
actions in different threads, at least one of which is not atomic, and neither
happens before the other. Any such data race results in undefined behavior.

Mutexes should be used to prevent data corruption when multiple threads need
access to common data. For (a very simple) example: the following could happen
when two threads access a common int variable, unless mutexes are used (a
emi(context switch) occurs when the operating system switches between
threads. With a mult-processor system the threads can really be executed in
parallel. To keep the example simple, assume multi threading is used on a
single-core computer, switching between multi-threads):
        verb(
Time step:    Thread1:      var        Thread2:        description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    0                        5
    1           starts                                  T1 active
    2           writes var                              T1 commences writing
    3           stopped                                 Context switch
    4                                   starts          T2 active
    5                                   writes var      T2 commences writing
    6                       10          assigns 10      T2 writes 10
    7                                   stopped         Context switch
    8           assigns 12                              T1 writes 12
    9                       12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    )
    The above is just a very simple illustration of what may go wrong when
multiple threads access the same data without using mutexes. 

Thread 2 proceeds on the assumption that tt(var) equals 10. However, after
step 9 tt(var) holds the value 12. Mutexes are used to prevent these kinds of
problems by offering a guarantee that thata are only accessed by the thread
holding a mutex for the those data.

Exclusive data access completely depends on cooperation between the
threads. If thread 1 uses mutexes, but thread 2 doesn't, then thread 2 may
access the common data any which way it wants to. Of course that's bad
practice, and mutexes allow us to write program not behaving badly in this
sense.

It is stressed that although em(using) mutexes is the programmer's
responsibility, their em(implementation) isn't. A user-program is unable to
accomplish em(atomic locking) mutexes offer. The bottom line is that if we try
to implement a mutex-like facility in our programs then each statement is
compiled into several machine instructions and in between each of these
instructions the operating system may do a context switch, rendering the
instructions non-atomic.

Mutexes offer the necessary atomic calls: when requesting a mutex-lock the
thread is suspended (i.e., the mutex statement does not return) until the lock
has been obtained by the thread.

More information about mutexes can be found in the link(mentioned O'Reilly
book)(PTHREADS) and in general in the extensive literature on this topic. It
is not a topic that is discussed further in the annotations(). The available
facilities for using mutexes, however, em(are) covered in this section.

Apart from the class tt(std::mutex) the class hi(recursive_mutex)
tt(std::recursive_mutex) is offered.  When a tt(recursive_mutex) is called
multiple times by the same thread it increases its lock-count. Before other
threads may access the protected data the recursive mutex must be unlocked
again that number of times. Moreover, the classes 
        hi(timed_mutex)tt(std::timed_mutex) 
    and 
        hi(recursive_timed_mutex)tt(std::recursive_timed_mutex) 
    are available. Their locks expire when released, but also after a certain
amount of time.

All mutex classes offer the following constructors and members:
    itemization(
    it() A default tt(constexpr) constructor;
    it() A destructor
    ithtq(lock)(void lock())
       (the calling thread is blocked until it has obtained ownership of the
        mutex. Unless tt(lock) is called for a recursive mutex a
        tt(system_error) is thrown if, e.g., the thread already owns the
        lock. Recursive mutexes increment their interal emi(lock count);)
    ithtq(try_lock)(bool try_lock() noexcept)
       (the calling thread tries to obtain ownership of the mutex without
        blocking. If ownership is obtained, tt(true) is returned, otherwise
        tt(false). If the lock was already obtained by the calling thread,
        tt(true) is also returned, and with a recursive mutex its interal
        emi(lock count) is also incremented;)
    ithtq(unlock)(void unlock() noexcept)
       (the calling thread releases ownership of the mutex.  A
        tt(system_error) is thrown if, e.g., the thread does not own the
        lock. Recursive mutexes decrement their interal lock count, releasing
        ownership of the mutex once the lock count has decayed to zero;)
    )
Note: mutex classes do not offer copy constructors and overloaded assignment
operators.

In addition to the abovementioned members, timed mutex classes
(tt(timed_mutex,)linebreak()tt(recursive_timed_mutex)) also offer:
    itemization(
    ithtq(try_lock_for)(bool try_lock_for(chrono::duration<Rep, Period> const 
            &relTime) noexcept)
       (this function is defined as a function template, defining the template
        header tt(template <typename Rep, typename Period>). The template's
        types are derived from the actual tt(relTime) argument that is passed
        to the function, and should not explicitly be specified. This function
        could be called for a tt(timed_mutex_lock tml) as, e.g.,
       verb(
tml.try_lock_for(seconds(5));
        )
       If the ownership is obtained within the specified time interval
        tt(true) is returned, otherwise tt(false). If the lock was already
        obtained by the calling thread, tt(true) is also returned, and with a
        recursive timed mutex its interal emi(lock count) is also
        incremented;)
        
    ithtq(try_lock_until)(bool try_lock_until(chrono::time_point<Clock,
            Duration> const &absTime) noexcept)
       (this function is also defined as a function template, defining the
        template header tt(template <typename Clock, typename Duration>). The
        tt(Clock) and tt(Duration) types are derived from the actual
        tt(absTime) argument that is passed to the function, and should not
        explicitly be specified. This function could be called for a
        tt(timed_mutex_lock tml) as, e.g.,
   verb(
tml.try_lock_until(system_clock::now() + seconds(5));
        )
       If the ownership is obtained before the specified point in time
        tt(true) is returned, otherwise tt(false). If the lock was already
        obtained by the calling thread, tt(true) is also returned, and with a
        recursive timed mutex its interal emi(lock count) is also
        incremented;)
    )
