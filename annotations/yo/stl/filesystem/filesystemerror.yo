The tt(experimental/filesystem) namespace offers its own exception type
ti(filesystem_error). It is derived from tt(std::exception), and its
constructors have the following signatures (the bracketed parameters are
optional): 
        verb(
    filesystem_error(string const &what, 
                    [path const &path1, [path const &path2,]] 
                    error_code ec);
        )
