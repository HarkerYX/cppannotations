 The C++ Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the C++ programming
 language. It can be used as a textbook for C/C++ programming courses.

 This document is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language
 using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about,
 or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for
 Frank's C++ programming courses, which are yearly organized at the University
 of Groningen, the Netherlands. 

 The C++ Annotations do not cover all aspects of C++, though. In particular,
 C++'s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes, equal to C's
 grammar, is not covered. For this part of the C++ language, the reader should
 consult other texts, like a book covering the C programming language.


To create the various document formats from the C++ Annotations' sources,
either descend into the 'annotations' directory, or unpack a created archive, cd
into its top-level directory and follow the instructions provided in the
INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, various binary ready-to-install packages of the C++ Annotations
are available in verious Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,

https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=c%2B%2B-annotations&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
