8.1.0~pre1  

  * Removed the 'template concepts' section from advancedtemplates: removed
    from the C++0x standard.
  * Started a cleanup operation on the C++ Annotations aiming at improving
    its internal consistency in examples and text. In this version 
    completed until (including) chapter 8.
