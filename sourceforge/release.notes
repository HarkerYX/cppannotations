8.3.1

  * Many typos, textual corrections and clarifications were processed, almost
    all were provided by Francesco Poli.

  * Sections about move operations were split into subsections

  * The Portuguese translations are lagging too much behind. I've removed them
    from the source archives, although they remain available at the svn
    repository.
