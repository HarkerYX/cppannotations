To install the C++ Annotations:

    0. To use the `build' script you must have `icmake'. Below it is assumed
       you do.

    1. Inspect the directories defined in INSTALL.im and change their
       definitions if that would suit you better.

    2. Execute:
        
            ./build docs

    3. Execute:
    
            ./build install

       optionally add another directory below which you'd like all documents
       to be installed. If not specified the root (/) directory is used,
       INSTALL.im's paths are appended to / or to your explicitly specified.
       E.g., the cpp-annotations man page is by default installed in 

            /usr/share/man/man7

       but if you issue the command

            ./build install /tmp/cpp-annot

       it will end up in

            /tmp/cpp-annot/usr/share/man/man7

       You must likely be the `root' user to use the default (i.e., /).
